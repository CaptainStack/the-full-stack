# Who is this for?

The field of computer science and the industry of sofware engineering are as big and broad as you would like them to be. One can spend their entire lives studying something as narrow as font rendering without ever touching even basic web development. Because of this and the sheer volume of available materials, it can be incredibly difficult to know when any one resource is what you need.

One of the goals of this project is to scale better from the complete newcomer to computer programming all the way up to professional software developers. It also aspires to provide a healthy mix of academic computer science concepts along with practical software engineering skills. It will be some mix of:

* Conceptual learning through reading, diagrams, and examples
* Practical exercises
* Reference material

If you are brand new to programming, this is a fantastic place to start. If you already know how to program but would like to learn the skills of a professional full stack web developer, this is a great resource for you. If you'd just like a crash course on JavaScript, Node/NPM, and React, this will also be what you're looking for.

# Who this isn't for

The Full Stack is intended to be a broad and comprehensive learning resource. The sort that could start your journey into computer programming and accompany you long into your career. However, it is oriented around teaching enough of the fundamentals to give the context one needs to go deeper on their own. As such, virtually none of the topics are examined in as much detail as a typical college course. For instnace, if you're here hoping to go deep into the nuances of Postgresql, you are unlikely to find what you need, though we do cover a fair amount of SQL and postgres.
