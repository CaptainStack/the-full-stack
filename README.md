# The Full Stack
This project is intended to be the definitive ramp up from programming novice to full-stack engineer.

For now, this is only a place where I will consolidate my resources, develop plans, and eventually deploy articles and applications that I intend to be a part of the curriculum. In time, it may take other forms such as a blog, a book, or courses.

This project is currently on the furthest back burner and may not see frequent updates.
