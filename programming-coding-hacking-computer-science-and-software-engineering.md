# Programming, computer science, and software engineering

So you've got a good idea for an app you'd like to make. You've heard about the attractive job markets and salaries for software engineers. You've had a teacher or a friend tell you that you really ought to learn to code. The only problem is, you have no clue what any of this means. Are software developers coders? Is what they do all day "programming" or "software engineering"? Does it matter?

Surprisingly, this initial bit of confusion is in fact a subtle observation of distinctions that are often not acknowledged by more experienced people in the industry, often to their own detriment. Mastery of every tool requires more time and disipline than anyone has, and so a large part of what a full stack engineer does is build and maintain a broad and useful knowledge map of many different concepts. This often means knowing quite a bit about a programming language or framework that they've never even written a single line of code for. And so we will begin to build our knowledge map here by understanding some of the most fundamental concepts and terminology in software.

## Programming and coding

Programming, coding, and hacking all are terms that have found their way into common usage. It's common for one to refer to their dad who works at Microsoft as a "computer programmer." Further, many of the organizations trying to bring these skills to the broader public do so under slogans like, "Anyone can code."

These active verbs are best understood by first considering their noun counterparts. A program is a set of instructions, written in code, that the computer can run. While not always the case, a single instruction is often (and usuall best) written in a single line of text. As such you'll often hear the word code paird with the number of lines. A small program might be a couple hundred "lines of code," but the entire program is written in "code."

And so going back to our verbs, coding and programming are simply the act of writing these instructions, and stringing them together into programs. Hollywood depictions of this process often make it seem as if the process is about furiously smashing a keyboard as fast as one can, but in reality the process is a far more pensive, iterative, and methodical. So when a person says they spent all day programming, what they probably did was write many lines of code, run them, see what happened, find mistakes, edit the code, run the code again, run the code again and watch what happens more carefully, and then edit again. The process is experimental, usually error prone, and often collaborative.

## Computer science

Even if you know how to write many different lines of code, and have perhaps even strung them together into a few programs, perhaps even highly entertaining or lucrative programs
